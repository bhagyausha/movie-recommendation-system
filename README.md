# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a project to develop a personalized movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system is built using Python and leverages the Surprise library to implement various collaborative filtering algorithms.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Utilizes the MovieLens dataset for training and testing the recommendation models.
- **Model Training**: Implements collaborative filtering algorithms like SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to predict user ratings for movies.
- **Evaluation**: Uses cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and build the recommendation model.

## Dataset
